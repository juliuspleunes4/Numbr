# 🧮 Numbr

**Numbr** is a modern, open-source calculator app built *exclusively* for iPadOS.  
Since Apple still hasn't shipped a native calculator for iPads, we decided to take matters into our own hands.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Basic arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- 🧠 **Smart input parsing** (e.g. `5 + 3 × 2` is interpreted correctly)
- 🔢 **Resizable UI** for full-screen & Split View support
- 🧰 **Built with SwiftUI**, designed for touch

**Planned:**

- 🧪 Scientific mode (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.)
- 🧮 Expression history
- 📱 iOS & MacOS support
